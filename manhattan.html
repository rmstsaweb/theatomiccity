    <p>The Manhattan Project was a top secret project in Tennesee where a city was built to build the atomic bomb who's claim to fame is that it won World War II, one of the biggest wars. During the Manhattan Project, people did not know that they were building an atomic bomb. This was intended for safety of the bomb. Secrecy was vital because they did not want other countries to try to stop them. Without the Manhattan Project, we might of lost World War II, which would lead to a Nazi World.</p>
